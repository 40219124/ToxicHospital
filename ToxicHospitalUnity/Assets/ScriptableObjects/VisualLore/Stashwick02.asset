    Manifesto\r\n\r\n20 January 2021.\r\nSubject: Cerebral Restoration Case Study
    #5\r\n        [REDACTED]/Patient 007\r\n\n1400: \r\r\nProgress has moved at a
    steady pace. Patient 007 has been responding to 4 of the 6 brain test criteria
    for Cerebrum Tissue Restoration. Motor functions seem to start and stop when
    we progress to test 5 of 6.\r\n\r\n1700:\r\nWe\u2019ve injected [REDACTED] into
    the cerebral cortex. Patient 007, has displayed no reaction that we can observe.
    Motor functions still exhibit the same sporadic ignitions to limb movement before
    failing. Granular analysis of restorative cells in the central cortex of 007\u2019s
    cerebral structure is required. \r\n\r\n2100:\r\nObservation and further study
    yeilded minute but hopeful results. Harrington is compiling all data yielded.
    We will quickly introduce a new variable in conjction with [REDACTED] at start
    of business tomorrow. Fidings are forthcoming.\r\n\r\nC.M Stashwick\r\nHead of
    Applied Research\r"
