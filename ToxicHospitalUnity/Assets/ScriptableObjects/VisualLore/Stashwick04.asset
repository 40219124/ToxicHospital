  objectText: "HARPO \r\nTECHNOLOGIES\r\n\r\nDr.Charles M Stashwick\r\nApplied Research
    Manifesto\r\n\r\n31 January 2021.\r\nSubject: Cerebral Restoration Case Study
    #11\r\n        [REDACTED]/Patient 007\r\n\r\n1100:\r\nWe have hit a road block
    with stimulating cerebral tissue growth in 007. After numerous tests upping the
    dosage of [REDACTED] along with [REDACTED], efforts to extend motor skills of
    the patient beyond [REDACTED] have been fruitless. Increased density and strength
    of ionic charges have also yeilded no discernable changes. We are now proceeding
    with Dr.Carla\u2019s Theory #3.1: [REDACTED].\r\n\r\nFindings will be forth coming.\r\n\r\n1700:\r\nPatient
    007 seems to be displaying adverse reaction to Theory #3.1. Dr.Harrington has
    suggested we suspend further trails of Theory #3.1\r\n\r\n1730:\r\n007\u2019s
    prognosis has deteriorated. Frustratingly, now the patient is unresponsive to
    [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. I am actively monitoring Patient 007\u2019s vitals
    for further change.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to Audio File #20 for supplimentary data
    regarding Theory 3.1 by Dr.Carla Bishop.\r\n\r\nC.M Stashwick\r\nHead of Applied
    Research\r\n\r\nReport 004"
