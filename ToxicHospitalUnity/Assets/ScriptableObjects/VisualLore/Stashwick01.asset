    Applied
    Research Manifesto

    

    15 January 2021.

    Subject: Investor''s Meeting

    

    Today
    was successful. After months of discussions, and stalling, Pres. Darson has finally
    negociated and secured further funding for Cerebral Regen Research, further allowing
    my department and I to continue our work. My Team and I are on the verge of a
    break through, and we were running precariously thin on resources.

    

    The
    team will be relieved to learn that we''ve been granted further permission to
    conduct our testing as we inch closer to cracking the [REDACTED] central to brain
    tissue restoration of the cerebral cortex.

    

    Our Investors, Florida
    State [REDACTED] and Mr. [REDACTED] seem concerned from what I discerned, but
    thankfully our research timeline provided enough proof that we are on track to
    perfecting the serum before the next review. A meeting will be held prior to
    1400 with the entire Applied Research Department to brief staff, and outline
    the next steps to ensure we reach our end goal.

    

    Carla and Harrington
    will be delighted to hear of our extention.

    Head
    of Applied Research
