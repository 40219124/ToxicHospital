    Manifesto\r\n\r\n21 January 2021.\r\nSubject: Cerebral Restoration Case Study
    #5\r\n        [REDACTED]/Patient 007\r\n\r\n0800:\r\nPatient 007 is now responding
    to test 5 of 6. Since introducing a low dosage of [REDACTED] in conjunction with
    [REDACTED] we have seen substantial progress in cellular restoration of the cerebral
    tissue. As I noted in \u201CAudio File #15\u201D in relation to Cerebral Restoration
    \u201CCase Study #7\u201D, 007\u2019s motor functions are no longer sporadic.
    He responds to [REDACTED] stimulation, but motor functions are not permanent.
    Patient can move eyes and blink for a maximum of just [REDACTED]. Curiously,
    patient exhibits no discernable aptitude of motion for other limbs of the body.
    I theorize [REDACTED] expend their [REDACTED] as they jump start the cellular
    restortaion of the central tissues within the cortex.\r\n\r\nFurther test and
    analysis is required, but findings are incredibly encouraging.\r\n\r\nThe team
    is inching ever closer to our breakthrough I can feel it.\r\n*Please refer to
    Audio File #15 for supplimentary data*.\r\n\r\nC.M Stashwick\r\nHead of Applied
    Research\r\n\r\nReport 003"
