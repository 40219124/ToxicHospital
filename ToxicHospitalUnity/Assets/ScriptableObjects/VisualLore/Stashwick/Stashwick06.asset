    Manifesto\r\n\r\n02 February 2021.\r\nSubject: Peter Darson\r\n\r\n        Cerebral
    Research in Jeopardy\r\n\r\n1030:\r\nTHAT SON OF A BITCH! FOUR YEARS OF RESEARCH!
    Four BLOODY YEARS, SEVENTEEN-HOUR DAYS!! And he wants to cancel all of our hard
    work! MY WORK!!!\r\n\r\nThe bastard! He wouldn\u2019t even listen to me. Kept
    rambling on about liability and insurance payouts. Men like him can never think
    about the greater good for man. It\u2019s always about their bottom line.\r\n\r\nAs
    if blood hasn\u2019t been on his greedy filthy hands before.\r\n\r\nI wont let
    him stop this. I wont let him sabotage this work. The ingrate doesn\u2019t see
    how he\u2019s damning mankind. I must do something to protect my work, I will
    NOT throw away years of my life so a billionaire can sleep better. My work is
    not inhumane. There are casualties in the persuit of scientific breakthroughs.\r\n\r\nALL
    SUCCESS COMES AT THE COST OF SACRIFCE!\r\n\r\nI know what needs to be done.\r\n\r\nA
    recording of my \u201Cconversation with the President is contained in Audio File
    #20.\r\nContext and supplimentary data are supported by audio file.\r\n\r\nC.M
