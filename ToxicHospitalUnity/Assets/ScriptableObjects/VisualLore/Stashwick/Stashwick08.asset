  objectText: "HARPO \r\nTECHNOLOGIES\r\n\r\nDr.Charles M Stashwick\r\nApplied Research
    Manifesto\r\n\r\n13 February 2021.\r\nSubject: Resignation\r\nFarewell\r\n\r\n0300:\r\nAll
    my data and research are backed up. I spent the last few days prepping for this
    moment but it still feels surreal. Peter sent out a departmental email, updating
    Applied Research of the changes coming into effect, with the Cerebral Regenerative
    Therapy Research now suspended indefinately. He\u2019s desided to move the department\u2019s
    focus to military weapon research. Predictable and a slap to the face! The bloody
    bastard! But I digress.\r\n\r\n*Please refer to President Peter Darson\u2019s
    Departmental email \r\n\u201CTaking Applied Research Forward\u201D for supplimentary
    data*\r\n\r\nI spoke with Peter a few hours ago. I tendered my resignation to
    him. He exclaimed that I \u201Cshould reconsider\u201D since he wasn\u2019t firing
    me, that he \u201Cconsidered me a friend\u201D. How so thoughful?. But, there
    is no \u201Creversing\u201D what has been set into motion. I told him \u201Cthank
    you but I can not be here any longer, my work here is, finished.\u201D I... ...
    ... I left him a... \u201Cparting gift\u201D. A \u201Ctoken\u201D of our \u201Cfriendship\u201D,
    if you will, and wished him good luck.\r\n\r\n*Please refer to Audio File #24
    for supplimentary data regarding \u201CConversation with the President\u201D*\r\n\r\nI
    was hoping Carla and Harrington would be around when I left. A shame really because
    they both deserve better than HARPO, this brilliant department deserves better
    than HARPO and PETER. But Alas, whats done, what I\u2019ve done... is done! I\u2019ve
    washed my hands clean of this place, I will continue my research on my own and
    change the world. I\u2019ll restore control to the body of those who have lost
    it.\r\n\r\nCarla! Harrington! It was a pleasure!\r\n\r\n*Refer to \u201CResignation
    of Charles Marrion Stashwisk\u201D for Supplimentary data*\r\n\r\nC.M Stashwick\r\nFormer
    Head of Applied Research\r\n\r\nReport 008"
