  objectText: "HARPO \r\nTECHNOLOGIES\r\n\r\nDr.Charles M Stashwick\r\nApplied Research
    Manifesto\r\n\r\n07 February 2021.\r\nSubject: Serum [REDACTED]\r\nA New Variable\r\n\r\n2210:\r\nProgress
    with the new serum has produced some interesting results. The first [REDACTED]
    within the serem was [REDACTED] and highly unstable. But after sleepless nights
    since the discontinuation of C.R. Ive managed to isolate the key protein within
    [REDACTED]\r\n\r\n2240:\r\nA new [REDACTED] variable has been introduced into
    the serum. The surface protiens and [REDACTED] are rapidly [REDACTED] I\u2019ve
    never seen such rapid [REDACTED] like this. This needs further stabilization
    if its to be deployed in the \u201Csafest\u201D of controlled environments.\r\n\r\n2330:\r\nThe
    [REDACTED] nature displayed within the serum has been reduced exponentially to
    satisfactory levels. I must test new serum, I\u2019m calling it [REDACTED] on
    a new subject and observe its interactions when it\u2019s isolated.\r\n\r\n08
    Feb 2021, 0200;\r\n\"Subject A\" between the hours of 0000 and 0100, displayed
    a subdued or lethargic disposition, if you will. Upon reintroduction of other
    subjects \u201CGroup A\u201D void of [REDACTED], behavior remained the unchanged
    for \u201CSubject A\u201D. Facinatingly \u201CGroup A\u201D, void of the new
    variant, displayed hostile behavior towards the subject. And then some unexpected.
    \u201CSubject A\u201D [REDACTED] ...slightly!.\r\n\r\nC.M Stashwick\r\nHead of
    Applied Research\r\n\r\nReport 007"
