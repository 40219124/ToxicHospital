  objectText: "HARPO \r\nTECHNOLOGIES\r\n\r\nDr.Charles M Stashwick\r\nApplied Research
    Manifesto\r\n\r\n02 February 2021.\r\nSubject: Candidate Decseased. C.R Case
    Study #15\r\n\r\n         [REDACTED]/Patient 007\r\n\r\n0800:\r\nWe\u2019ve experienced
    a major set back. Leading candiate for our [REDACTED], [REDACTED], research alias
    \u201CPatient 007\u2019s\u201D vitals shut down on Monday 01, February 2021.
    Time of death was 2315. Patient was under the close observation of Julia Harly,
    Brido Doyle, associate scientists of Deputy Director Harrington Lang.\r\n\r\nAll
    methods to resustate the patient was exhauted and proved unsuccessful. Harrington
    and an [REDACTED] contracted by Harpo, was brought in to conduct a full forensic
    analysis for cause of death. Carla has since notified President Peter Darson
    of Harpo Technologies and is currently drafting a \u201CNotice of Death\u201D
    for the patient\u2019s next of kin.\r\n\r\nI am disappointed. I grieve!. This
    could not have happened at a more crucial time of our research. No other candifate
    has progressed to stage 5 of our tests, or responded so promisingly to the trails
    of Serum [REDACTED]. ... FUCK!\r\n\r\nI\u2019m dreading the conversation I must
    have with Peter. Two weeks out from our deadline review and he just goes on and
    DIES!\r\n\r\nDAMN IT, WHY!?\r\n\r\nSupplimentary coroners report is forth coming..
    Please refer to patient \"Mortality Report 7a\". by Deputy Director of Applied
    Research Dr. Harrinton Lang.\r\n\r\nC.M Stashwick\r\nHead of Applied Research\r\n\r\nReport
